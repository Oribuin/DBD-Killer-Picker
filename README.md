# Dead By Daylight Character Picker
The Dead By Daylight Picker allows users to select their desired role, Choosing between killer or survivor.
<br><br>
You can then choose which survivors you own or don't own to let the website give you characters you own. Press the refresh button and it will give you a random character for you to play.
<br><br>
This is great for users who are indecisive such as myself
